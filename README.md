# AccessAble

AccessAble is a project dedicated to showcasing current accessibility tools available for web users. Its goal is to raise awareness and provide resources for making the web more inclusive for everyone, including people with disabilities.

## What is Accessibility?

Web accessibility refers to the practice of designing and developing websites, applications, and digital tools so that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with them effectively. This includes people with various disabilities such as:

- **Visual impairments**: Blindness, low vision, color blindness
- **Hearing impairments**: Deafness or hearing loss
- **Motor impairments**: Limited fine motor control, paralysis
- **Cognitive impairments**: Learning disabilities, memory issues, attention disorders

Accessibility benefits everyone, not just people with disabilities. Features like captions, keyboard navigation, and clear design improve the user experience for all users.

## Why is Web Accessibility Important?

Web accessibility is crucial for several reasons:

- **Legal compliance**: Many countries have laws requiring digital accessibility (e.g., ADA in the US, AODA in Canada, EN 301 549 in the EU)
- **Inclusive design**: Ensures equal access to information and functionality for all users
- **Business benefits**: Expands your potential audience and customer base
- **Better user experience**: Accessibility improvements often enhance usability for everyone
- **Social responsibility**: Promotes digital equity and inclusion in our increasingly digital world
- **SEO benefits**: Many accessibility practices also improve search engine optimization
